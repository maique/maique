### Hey there, my name is maique.

Iâ€™m a _geeky_ photographer, who [toots](https://mastodon.social/@maique) & [tweets](http://twitter.com/maique). Maybe too much.

Iâ€™m married to [movieStar](https://www.instagram.com/explore/tags/mybrideisamodel/) and we have a brand new baby, tinyMovieStar. 

I have some photos on [flickr](http://flickr.com/photos/maique/), there's a sort of life log on [instagram](http://instagram.com/maique), and, if youâ€™re looking for an _official_ site, thereâ€™s one at [maiquemadeira.com](http://maiquemadeira.com/).

Oh, and you can read 'maique' as 'mike'. That's how it sounds when a Portuguese reads it... 

Home is sweet and sunny [Lisbon](https://maiquemadeira.com/touristintown). Home is also the lovely island of [PrÃ­ncipe](https://maiquemadeira.com/principepeople). 

If you'd like to get in touch, or just to say hi, you can do that on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/maique), [Telegram](https://t.me/maique), [Mastodon](https://mastodon.social/@maique), or the very classic [contact form](https://maiquemadeira.com/about) (yep, got one of those too).
