### Hey there, my name is maique.

Iâ€™m a _geeky_ photographer, who [tweets](https://twitter.com/maique) & [toots](https://mastodon.social/@maique). 

Iâ€™m married to [movieStar](https://www.instagram.com/explore/tags/mybrideisamodel/) and we have a baby, tinyMovieStar. Iâ€™m **VERY** lucky!

**Looking for photos?** Sure...
I have some photos on [Flickr](https://flickr.com/photos/maique/), there's a sort of life log on [Instagram](https://instagram.com/maique), and, if youâ€™re looking for an _official_ site, youâ€™ll find one at [maiquemadeira.com](https://maiquemadeira.com/).

**Stuff to read?** Look no further, thatâ€™s what [{micro maique}](https://micro.maiquemadeira.com/) is here for. 

Oh, and you can read '**maique**' as '**mike**'. That's how it sounds when a Portuguese reads it... 

Home is sweet and sunny [Lisbon](https://maiquemadeira.com/touristintown).  
Home is also the lovely island of [PrÃ­ncipe](https://maiquemadeira.com/principepeople).
